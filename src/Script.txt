INTRODUCTION


PAIN POINT
    - As a school district, we are responsible for the access our parents have to the involvement
    what happens on our camppuses. We understand the reality of some of our parents who work two 
    maybe even three jobs and who cannot afford the time to come out to campus to tell us what they
    think of the decisions we are making. 
    -That is why we built this website. At the core of this website is accessibility for our parents 
    we hope that parents can log onto this website after a long day and find just the right information
    they need
    - Lastly we know that some parents cannot always voice their opinions because quite frankly, they are 
    busy with work. Let us show you how we solved some of these pressing issues to give the information 
    and the voice back to our parents  


THE ADMIN HUB
    -The admin hub was designed to empower parents to share their perspective on some of the questions the
    school and the community are trying to understand. 
    
    VOTING FEATURE
        -From understanding what day works best for most of our parents to make it out to Teach/Parent Night to 
        what food the community wants to see at the school fair, our voting feature allows our parents to quickly 
        share their vote with us so we can make informed decisions

    SCHOOL MEETING SUMMARIES
        -We understand how important transparency is in building a trusting relationship with our community. We 
        want our community to see front and center that we always put student well being and student success at 
        the center of the decisions we make  


DASHBOARD
    -The website was designed with the parent perspective. That is why we have created the dashboard. A place where 
    they can find a lot of the most important information they need.
